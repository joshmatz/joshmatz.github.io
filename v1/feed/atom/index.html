<p><a title="Photoshop Etiquette" href="http://photoshopetiquette.com/">The Photoshop Etiquette Manifesto for Web Designers</a> covers some basic guidelines for working in Photoshop. Some items are obvious but when starting out it&#8217;s always helpful to have affirmation that you&#8217;re doing things right. Other items aren&#8217;t as obvious, such as the suggestion to choose &#8220;Progressive&#8221; when saving JPEGs. Ever notice some websites load a low quality image and progressively get sharper? Yup, that&#8217;s the setting. The Photoshop Etiquette Manifesto for Web Designers also has helpful screenshots to demonstrate suggestions.</p>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.joshmatz.com/2011/01/21/silence/"><![CDATA[<pre>There are some qualities- some incorporate things,
That have a double life, which thus is made
A type of that twin entity which springs
From matter and light, evinced in solid and shade.
There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shore-
Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
Some human memories and tearful lore,
Render him terrorless: his name's "No More."
He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
No power hath he of evil in himself;
But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,
That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod
No foot of man,) commend thyself to God!
<em>- Edgar Allen Poe</em></pre>

        <content type="html" xml:base="http://www.joshmatz.com/2011/01/20/quora-the-qa-website-that-does-it-right/"><![CDATA[<p>I decided to try out Quora for the first time this past week and, ya know, it&#8217;s pretty good! I&#8217;ve used other websites (Stack Overflow, Yahoo Answers) but have never found myself going back to them just to see more questions and answers.</p>
<p>I started my account by hooking in Facebook first and after allowing it access I was then prompted for my email address and a password so I could login next time.</p>
<p>Once they had my email and password I was shown a page that looked very much like this:<br />
<div style="text-align:center;"><span class="frame aligncenter"><img src="http://www.joshmatz.com/v1/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-19-at-10.47.55-PM.png" /></span></div><br />
These are the results my girlfriend got when we signed her up. Pretty much everything listed above was spot on for her, expect maybe <em>Rock Music</em> and <em>Play</em>. Because I&#8217;m in Graphic Design student, Quora gave me very relevant topics such as the obvious, <em>HTML</em>, <em>CSS</em> and <em>Graphic Design</em>. If you click the &#8220;Follow&#8221; link on any of the present options, a new topic replaces the item you followed. I clicked &#8220;Follow&#8221; a good 10 times because the suggestions were all so good!</p>
<p><div style="text-align:center;"><span class="frame aligncenter"><img src="http://www.joshmatz.com/v1/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Screen-shot-2011-01-19-at-10.49.24-PM.png" /></span></div><br />
The interface is super intuitive. I&#8217;m not sure the particular algorithm that Quora uses to decide which questions have an answer displayed with them, but it works very well. It displays an abbreviated portion of the answer and if you&#8217;d like to read more, just click &#8220;(more)&#8221; and the full answer appears without loading a separate page.</p>
<p>Quora definitely has me enthralled. The answers posted have been insightful from the lot I&#8217;ve seen and the interface shines in all it&#8217;s AJAXy gloriousness.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re curious about things or find yourself needing a question answered, try Quora!</p>
