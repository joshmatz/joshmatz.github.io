Hello there! I’m Josh Matz and I’m currently living in Austin, Texas with my wife, Rachael Matz, and dog Kindle. (There’s also a cat, Tonks, but I let Rachael take ownership of him.)

I’m a self taught web developer and received a BFA in Graphic Design at Baylor University. I’m currently working at [InVision](http://www.invisionapp.com) where I help make the world's leading prototyping, collaboration & workflow platform. Previous employers include [SourceClear](https://srcclr.com) (a security startup) and [Springbox](http://www.springbox.com) (a digital agency).

If you like my work, feel free to get in touch or catch me on Twitter [@joshmatz](https://twitter.com/joshmatz).
