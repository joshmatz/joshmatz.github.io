                    <p>Hello there! I’m Josh Matz and I’m currently living in Austin, Texas with my wife, Rachael Matz, and dog Kindle. (There’s also a cat, Tonks, but I let Rachael take ownership of him.)</p>

<p>I’m a self taught web developer and received a BFA in Graphic Design at Baylor University. I’m currently working at <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com">InVision</a> where I help make the world&rsquo;s leading prototyping, collaboration &amp; workflow platform. Previous employers include <a href="https://srcclr.com">SourceClear</a> (a security startup) and <a href="http://www.springbox.com">Springbox</a> (a digital agency).</p>
